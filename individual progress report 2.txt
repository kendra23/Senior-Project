I have finished coding all of my recipes for the website. With that I have also put them in the format that I want so that the layout can be easy for the user to understand. This makes it so that everything is in one place and the look of the website is seamless. I have also started to work on the pages that will host the recipes so that the user can click on the image that they want and it will bring them to the ingredients and the instructions. As a whole the database is being worked on as well as allowing the users to leave comments on the page that others would be able to see. Everyone else is also working on typing up their recipes so that the format on all of the pages are the same.
