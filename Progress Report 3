i have connected all of my pages together withthe homepage so that it would be easy to go between pages and visualize the wwebpage as a whole.
i have also been working on getting the search bar on the homepage to work so that it shows up properly. i am still working on that.
i have also been doing research on how to connect our database to the website so that terms could be searchable.

the group as a whole has also work on finishing up their recipes so that the website could be done and has also be working on the database.
we are at the point where we wantto make sure everything look harmonious and makes sense to the user.
