finishing uploading all of the recipes onto the website and making sure that all of the pictures are coming up andthe links works.
i am alos working on the php to connect the website to tthe database so tthat we could use thte search bar to look up recipes.
i also helped with getting the informattion and figuring out how to ttransfer our database into xampp becasue we need it on there 
so that it tcould run.
